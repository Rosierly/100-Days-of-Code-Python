# Day 4 â€“ Randomisation & Python Lists | Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

---

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

Today I worked with Pythonâ€™s `random` module and practiced managing and manipulating lists:

- Used `random.randint()` to generate random integers within a range
- Explored `random.choice()` to select random elements from a list
- Learned to generate random floats using `random.random()` and `random.uniform()`
- Created, accessed, and modified lists using indexing and methods like `.append()` and `.extend()`
- Practiced negative indexing and how to prevent `IndexError`
- Imported external modules to organize code better
- Worked with nested lists and the `.index()` method
- Used `.split()` to break strings into lists, and `.strip()` to clean up input

## ðŸ›  Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

An interactive terminal-based game where the player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors to play against the computer.

- Utilizes the `random` module to generate the computerâ€™s unpredictable move  
- Accepts and validates user input to ensure correct gameplay  
- Uses lists to store and display ASCII art for each option  
- Organizes code into functions for clarity and reusability  
- Includes a replay feature to allow multiple rounds without restarting the program
