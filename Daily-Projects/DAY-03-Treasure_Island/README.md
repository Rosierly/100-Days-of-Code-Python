# Day 3 â€“ Conditionals & Logic | Treasure Island Game

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

Today I practiced using Python's conditional statements to control program flow:

- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision-making
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not` for combining conditions
- Nested conditionals (conditions inside conditions)
- Modulo operator `%` to check for remainders (useful for even/odd)
- String methods `lower()` and `upper()` to handle case sensitivity
- Use of triple quotes for multi-line strings (used here for ASCII art)

## ðŸ›  Project: Treasure Island Text Adventure

A text-based adventure console game where the player makes choices to find the hidden treasure.

- Demonstrates how nested conditional statements control different story paths.
- Uses user input to drive branching outcomes and interactive gameplay.
- Different choices result in either winning or losing the game.
