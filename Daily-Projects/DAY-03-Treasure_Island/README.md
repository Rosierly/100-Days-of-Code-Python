# Day 3 - Treasure Island Game

A text-based adventure game where the player makes choices to find the treasure.

### How it works:
- Presents the player with a series of choices via input prompts.
- Each choice leads to a different outcome or the next decision point.
- The goal is to find the treasure by choosing the correct path.

### What I learned:
- **Conditional if/else statements**: Making decisions based on conditions.
- **Operators**: Symbols that perform operations like comparisons.
- **Comparison Operators**: Comparing values (e.g., `>`, `<`, `==`).   
   *Assignment (`=`) vs Equality (`==`) Operators*: Assigning values vs checking equality.
- **Modulo Operator (%)**: Finding the remainder of a division.
- **Nested if/else and if/elif/else**: Handling multiple decision branches.
- **Multiple if Statements in Succession**: All independent conditions are checked.
- **Logical Operators**: Combining conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not`.
- **String Methods `.lower()` and `.upper()`**: Changing letter case.
- **Triple Quotes (`'''` or `"""`)**: Creating multiline strings, like ASCII art.
