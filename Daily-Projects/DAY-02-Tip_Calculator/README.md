# Day 2 â€“ Python Data Types & Tip Calculator

---

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

Today I explored Pythonâ€™s core data types and basic operations:

- Understanding **Strings**, **Integers**, **Floats**, and **Booleans**
- Accessing elements in strings using **subscripting**
- Identifying common errors: `TypeError` and `ValueError`
- Checking and converting data types with `type()`, `int()`, `float()`, `str()`
- Performing mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation
- Learning operator precedence with **PEMDAS**
- Rounding numbers with the `round()` function
- Using assignment operators like `+=`
- Formatting output using **f-strings**

## ðŸ›  Project: Tip Calculator

A simple interactive Python script that:

- Asks the user for the total bill amount
- Collects the desired tip percentage (10, 12, or 15)
- Asks how many people will split the bill
- Calculates the amount each person should pay, including tip, rounded to 2 decimal places

**Sample output:** Each person should pay: $12.50
