# Day 7 - Hangman Game

A classic hangman game where the user chooses difficulty, guesses letters, and tries to reveal the hidden word before running out of lives.

### How it works:
- Prompts the user to select a difficulty level (Easy, Normal, Hard).
- Randomly picks a word from the selected difficulty category.
- Shows the word as underscores and updates with correct guesses.
- Tracks guessed letters to avoid repeated guesses.
- Decreases lives for wrong guesses, showing hangman stages.
- Ends when the user either guesses all the letters in the word correctly or runs out of lives.

### What I learned:
- **Flow chart Programming**: Using flowcharts to visually represent the logic and steps of a program.
- **Using Variables Inside and Outside Loops**: Variables defined inside loops keep their last assigned value after the loop finishes.
- **How to import modules in Python**: Different ways to import whole modules, specific items, and using aliases.
- **in & not in Keyword**: Checking if a value exists or does not exist in a sequence (like lists or strings).
