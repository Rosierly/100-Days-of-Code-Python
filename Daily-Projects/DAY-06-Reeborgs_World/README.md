# Day 6 - Reeborgs World

No final project

### What I learned:
- **Functions**: Blocks of reusable code that can take inputs and return results.
- **Indentation**: Using spaces to organize code into blocks like loops and functions.
- **While Loops**: Run code repeatedly while a condition is true.
- **Infinite Loop**: A while loop that never stops because its condition is always true.
- **Difference between For & While Loops**:  
  For loops go through items in a sequence; while loops run while a condition is true.
- **Two uses of For Loops**:  
  1. Loop through items in a list or iterable.  
  2. Loop through a range of numbers with `range()`.
