# Day 1 - Band Name Generator

A simple Python program that generates a band name by combining the name of your hometown and your pet's name.

### How it works:
- Prompts the user to enter the city they grew up in.
- Prompts the user to enter their petâ€™s name.
- Combines both inputs and prints a fun band name suggestion.
