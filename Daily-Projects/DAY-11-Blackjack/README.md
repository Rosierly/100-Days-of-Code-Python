# Day 11 - Blackjack Game üÉè

A Python program that simulates a simplified game of Blackjack where the user plays against the computer (dealer).

### How it works:
- Each player (user and dealer) starts with two random cards.
- The user chooses to draw more cards (`hit`) or stop (`stand`).
- Aces can be worth 11 or 1, depending on hand value.
- The dealer draws until reaching at least 17.
- Final scores are compared, and the winner is determined.

### What I learned:

- **append() vs extend() vs +=**:  
  - `append()` adds a single item to the end of a list.  
  - `extend()` and `+=` add elements from an iterable (like another list) one by one.  
  - `+=` is a shorthand for `extend()`, but only works when adding compatible types.
