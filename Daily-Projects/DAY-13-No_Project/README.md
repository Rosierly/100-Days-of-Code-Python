# Day 13 - Debugging Techniques (No Final Project)

A day focused entirely on learning and practicing different debugging strategies in Python — identifying, reproducing, and fixing bugs efficiently.

---

### What I learned:
- **Debugging Process**: The step-by-step method to locate and fix bugs — describing the problem, reproducing it, playing computer, fixing errors, printing variables, and using debuggers.
  - **Describe the Problem**: Clearly define what the code should do versus what it’s doing wrong to pinpoint the issue.
  - **Reproduce the Bug**: Run the program in a consistent way that reliably triggers the bug for easier troubleshooting.
  - **Play Computer**: Manually walk through the code line by line to identify where logic fails.
  - **Fix the Errors**: Correct syntax and logic mistakes, handle exceptions, and ensure proper type usage and formatting.
  - **Print is Your Friend**: Use print statements to track variable values and program flow during execution.
  - **Use a Debugger**: Step through code execution with debugging tools, use breakpoints, and inspect variables in real time to find and fix issues.
