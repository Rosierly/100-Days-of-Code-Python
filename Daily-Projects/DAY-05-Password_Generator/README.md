# Day 5 - Password Generator

A program that generates a random password based on user-specified numbers of letters, symbols, and numbers.

### How it works:
- Prompts the user to enter how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.
- Randomly selects the specified amount of characters from each category.
- Combines and shuffles all chosen characters.
- Outputs a randomized, strong password string.

### What I learned:
- **For Loop**: Iterating over sequences like lists or strings to execute code multiple times.
- **For Loops and the range() Function**: Using `range()` to generate sequences of numbers for controlled loops.
- **sum() Function**: Calculating the total of numbers in an iterable; mimicking with loops.
- **max() Function**: Finding the largest value in an iterable; mimicking with loops.
- **len() Function**: Getting the count of items in sequences; mimicking with loops.
- **statistics.mean() Function**: Computing the average of numbers; mimicking with loops.
- **List concatenation - Merging two lists**: Combining lists using `+`, `.extend()`, or `.append()` in loops.
- **isdigit() Method**: Validating if a string contains only digits.
- **shuffle() Method**: Randomly reordering list elements using `random.shuffle()`.
- **join() Method**: Concatenating list elements into a string using a separator with `.join()`.
